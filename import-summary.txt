ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .gitignore
* AUTHORS
* LICENSE
* README.0.82
* build.properties
* build.xml
* cocos2d-android\
* cocos2d-android\locks\
* cocos2d-android\locks\db.lock
* default.properties
* pom.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi\libgdx.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libgdx.so
* libs\cocos2d-android.jar => app\libs\cocos2d-android.jar
* libs\x86\libgdx.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libgdx.so
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\org\cocos2d\tests\test.lst => app\src\main\resources\org\cocos2d\tests\test.lst

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
